                  Sachetataa Foundation is committed to fostering awareness,
                  building strong communities, and facilitating early
                  intervention for children with communication disorders. Our
                  mission is to create a world where every child, regardless of
                  their communication challenges, has the opportunity to thrive,
                  communicate effectively, and be embraced by a supportive and
                  understanding community. Sachetataa Foundation envisions a
                  world where children with special needs are not only
                  recognized but are provided with equal opportunities for
                  growth, learning, and integration into society. The
                  organization aims to empower these children to lead fulfilling
                  lives while fostering a supportive community that actively
                  engages with their unique needs.

                  Knowledge about children with communication disorders and
                  identification of such children is very essential for the all
                  the stake holders as it helps in early intervention through
                  multidisciplinary approach. Moreover, most of these disorders
                  affect acquisition and development of academic skill. In
                  India, the prevalence rate of communication disorders among
                  school going children is approx. between 20- 30%. In this
                  scenario, management, teachers and parents have an important
                  role to play. Early years in child’s life are crucial for
                  laying early foundation for later years of education.
                  Pre-primary stage includes age group from 3-6 years. This
                  stage of development is a bench mark for school readiness
                  towards primary education.

                  The brain development during pre-school years is very rapid
                  hence setting right direction for learning in pre - school
                  years helps to establish desired attitude to learning.The
                  right direction could only be set if children are assessed for
                  their developmental levels in various domains. Delayed
                  development affects child’s adaptive behavior, which is
                  manifested through concurrent impairments in motor, language
                  and cognitive areas. Children with delayed development or
                  arrested development face difficulties in motor, cognitive,
                  language and social skills. Screening provides a quick look at
                  how children are doing in important areas, such as
                  communication, motor, socio emotional, self-help and
                  problem-solving skills. Such screening tools help immensely to
                  help identify child’s strengths as well as any areas where
                  child may need support. Inclusive education will only be
                  possible if the team including teachers, professionals and
                  parents work together for children with special need.
